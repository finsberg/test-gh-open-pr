However, their usefulness is limited by the relative immaturity of the cells’ electrophysiological properties as compared to native cardiomyocytes in the adult human heart. In this work, we extend and improve on methodology to address this limitation, building on previously introduced computational procedures which predict drug effects for adult cells based on changes in optical measurements of action potentials and Ca2+ transients made in stem cell derived cardiac microtissues. This methodology quantifies ion channel changes through the inversion of data into a mathematical model, and maps this response to an adult phenotype through the assumption of functional invariance of fundamental intracellular and membrane channels during maturation. Here, we utilize an updated action potential model to represent both hiPSC-CMs and adult cardiomyocytes, apply an IC50-based model of dose-dependent drug effects, and introduce a continuation-based optimization algorithm for analysis of dose escalation measurements using five drugs with known effects. The improved methodology can identify drug induced changes more efficiently, and quantitate important metrics such as IC50 in line with published values. Consequently, the updated methodology is a step towards employing computational procedures to elucidate drug effects in adult cardiomyocytes for new drugs using stem cell-derived experimental tissues.","authors":"Karoline Horgmo Jæger, Verena Charwat, Bérénice Charrez, Henrik Finsberg, Mary M Maleckar, Samuel Wall, Kevin E Healy, Aslak Tveito","journal":"","volume":"10","issue":"","pages":"1648","publisher":"Frontiers Media SA","pdf_url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2019.01648/full","scholar_url":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDPIHoEAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDPIHoEAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC","date":"2020/2/12"},{"title":"Efficient estimation of personalized biventricular mechanical function employing gradient‐based optimization","year":2018,"num_citations":47,"abstract":" Individually personalized computational models of heart mechanics can be used to estimate important physiological and clinically‐relevant quantities that are difficult, if not impossible, to directly measure in the beating heart.

During a normal beat, the initial stimulus to drive the heart originates from a group of pacemaker cells located in the atria, and electrically propagates first through the atria and then down into and through the ventricles. This traveling stimulus activates the myocytes as it arrives, driving a cascade of cellular processes that end in the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This calcium then causes the activation and cycling of actin-myosin cross-bridges within the myocytes, creating the muscle contraction that pumps blood throughout the body. The propagating electrical signal and the resulting contraction of the heart tissues are tightly coupled and highly coordinated to allow the pump to work efficiently and react to changing needs of the body. However, this tight coupling also can drive pathology. For example, if something is wrong in the electrical processes, it might manifest as an irregular contraction. Or, when the heart tissue is stretched or contracts irregularly, there are mechanisms at the cellular level that can alter the electrical behavior and drive dangerous arrhythmias.Modeling and simulation are used extensively to describe the physics of these electrical and mechanical processes and how they are connected.

However, it is currently impossible to measure stresses safely in vivo in a human heart. This necessitates the use of computational models in cardiac stress calculation. A key step to making simulated stresses useful for clinical practice is patient specificity. This means that the simulated stresses should come from a computational model that has been calibrated to behave in the same way as a patient’s heart. Doing this typically involves first creating a patient specific geometry, and then using available clinical data to personalize the mechanics of a computational model. One source of mechanical data that is currently available is dynamic left ventricular strain, which can be obtained cheaply and efficiently using 4D echocardiography methods. In our study, we combine such strain data with left ventricular pressure and volume measurements in order to match simulated bi-ventricular mechanics to those observed in the ventricles of a patient. We formulate this matching as a mathematical optimization problem in which the least squares difference between simulated and measured strains and volumes is minimized. This minimization is carried out using a gradient based optimization algorithm and an automatically derived adjoint equation. As a result, we obtain patient specific stress maps that can be used to improve the treatment of cardiac conditions in which stress plays a significant role.DATA COLLECTION The data used in our study were collected at the Oslo University Hospital from 8 patients suffering from heart failure …","authors":"Henrik N Finsberg, Gabriel Balaban, Joakim Sundnes, Hans Henrik Odland, Marie Rognes, Samuel T Wall","journal":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","publisher":"","pdf_url":"https://web-backend.simula.no/sites/default/files/publications/files/abstract.pdf","scholar_url":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDPIHoEAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDPIHoEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC","date":"2015"},{"title":"Spatial modeling algorithms for reactions and transport (SMART) in biological cells","year":2024,"num_citations":0,"abstract":"Biological cells rely on precise spatiotemporal coordination of biochemical reactions to control their many functions. Such cell signaling networks have been a common focus for mathematical models, but they remain challenging to simulate, particularly in realistic cell geometries. Herein, we present our software, Spatial Modeling Algorithms for Reactions and Transport (SMART), a package that takes in high-level user specifications about cell signaling networks and molecular transport, and then assembles and solves the associated mathematical and computational systems. SMART uses state-of-the-art finite element analysis, via the FEniCS Project software, to efficiently and accurately resolve cell signaling events over discretized cellular and subcellular geometries. We demonstrate its application to several different biological systems, including YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction, calcium signaling in neurons and cardiomyocytes, and ATP generation in mitochondria. Throughout, we utilize experimentally-derived realistic cellular geometries represented by well-conditioned tetrahedral meshes. These scenarios demonstrate the applicability, flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of SMART across a range of temporal and spatial scales.","authors":"Emmet A Francis, Justin G Laughlin, Jørgen S Dokken, Henrik NT Finsberg, Christopher T Lee, Marie E Rognes, Padmini Rangamani","journal":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","publisher":"","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15968","scholar_url":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDPIHoEAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDPIHoEAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC","date":"2024/5/24"},{"title":"A computational study of right ventricular mechanics in a rat model of pulmonary arterial hypertension","year":2024,"num_citations":0,"abstract":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) presents a significant challenge to right ventricular (RV) function due to progressive pressure overload, necessitating adaptive remodeling in the form of increased wall thickness, enhanced myocardial contractility and stiffness to maintain cardiac performance.

In addition, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of how each mechanism individually influences RV mechanics. Utilizing experimental data from a rat model of PAH at three distinct time points, we developed biventricular finite element models to investigate how RV stress and strain evolved with PAH progression. The finite element models were fitted to hemodynamic and morphological data to represent different disease stages and used to analyze the impact of RV remodeling as well as the altered RV pressure. Furthermore, we performed a number of theoretical simulation studies with different combinations of morphological and physiological remodeling, to assess and quantify their individual impact on overall RV load and function. Our findings revealed a substantial 4-fold increase in RV stiffness and a transient 2-fold rise in contractility, which returned to baseline by week 12. These changes in RV material properties in addition to the 2-fold increase in wall thickness significantly mitigated the increase in wall stress and strain caused by the progressive increase in RV afterload.

However, their usefulness is limited by the immaturity of the cells’ electrophysiological properties compared to the native cardiomyocytes in the adult human heart. In this paper, we apply a previously introduced computational procedure aimed at predicting drug effects for mature cells based on drug effects observed for immature cells. In the procedure, drug effects on individual ion channels are estimated from optical measurements of the action potential and calcium transient of immature cells and the identified drug effects are mapped to the mature case using an assumption of functional invariance of the intracellular and membrane proteins during maturation. In the current paper, we improve and extend the previously applied methodology by extending the action potential model used to represent the immature and mature cells, applying an IC50-based modeling of dose-dependent drug effects, and introducing a continuation-based optimization algorithm for inverting the optical measurements. The improved methodology is shown to give reasonable results for measurements of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes exposed to five drugs with known effects. Consequently, the updated methodology could be a step in the right direction towards applying the computational procedure to estimate mature drug effects for new drugs based on optical measurements of immature cells.","authors":"Karoline H Jæger, Verena Charwat, Bérénice Charrez, Henrik Finsberg, Samuel Wall, Kevin E Healy, Aslak Tveito","journal":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"247","publisher":"","pdf_url":"https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/101718/1/Jaeger_2019_thesis.pdf#page=255","scholar_url":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDPIHoEAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDPIHoEAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC","date":""},{"title":"Optimization of a Spatially Varying Cardiac Contraction parameter using the Adjoint Method","year":0,"num_citations":0,"abstract":"Henrik Finsberg, Simula Research Laboratory, henriknf@ simula. no, Gabriel Balaban, Simula Research Laboratory, gabrib@ simula. no, Joakim Sundnes, Simula Research Laboratory, sundnes@ simula. no, Marie E.

This is mainly due to better imaging techniques, increasing computational power combined with more efficient numerical methods, but also to the fact that computational models allows us to compute features such as mechanical stress that otherwise are impossible to measure in-vivo. This can provide us with an increased understanding of the complex mechanical events occurring during a heartbeat.In this study we use left ventricular cavity volumes and regional strains obtained from speckle tracking echocardiography, along with invasive blood pressure measurements, to personalize the mechanics of a cardiac computational model. The patients considered suffer from dyssynchronous heart failure in which the timing of mechanical activation varies between the different regions of the heart. These variations are captured by the measured regional strains. However, in order to capture these regional differences in the model, it is essential to allow the contractility to vary in space as well as in time. We introduce the contractility as a high-resolution field and use adjoint optimization techniques to fit the model to the measured data at a cost the does not significantly depend upon the resolution of the contractility field.","authors":"Henrik Finsberg, Gabriel Balaban, Joakim Sundnes, Marie E Rognes, Hans-Henrik Odland, Stian Ross, Samuel Wall","journal":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","publisher":"","pdf_url":"https://web-backend.simula.no/sites/default/files/publications/files/vph_abstract_finsberg.pdf","scholar_url":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDPIHoEAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDPIHoEAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC","date":""},{"title":"Mechanical Analysis of Pulmonary Hypertension via Adjoint based Data Assimilation of a Finite Element Model","year":0,"num_citations":0,"abstract":"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with an elevated pressure in the pulmonary arterial system.
